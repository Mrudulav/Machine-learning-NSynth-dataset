# Machine-learning-NSynth-dataset
Works on the creation of a network for NSynth dataset. NSynth stands for Neural Audio Synthesis and is a dataset containing of about 300,000 musical notes that can be classified using their unique pitch, timbre and envelope. 

Aim: Classify 10 different classes of sounds by training the system to understand the waves.


There are 3 files that are uploaded.
project_simple is a simple network creation that does the classification easily but lacks in efficiency and this error is fixed by using project_complex where we use a complex network by adding more hidden layers and inturn improving classification performance.

project_bonus deals with with classifying 3 kinds of music-orchestra,acoustic and metal. It has the highest classification rate with a 88% accuracy rate.
